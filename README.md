🔐 Cybersecurity, Network & Cloud Awareness

Security principles applied across projects include:
1.Secure password storage using hashing
2.Session-based authentication and access control
3.Input validation and basic error handling
4.Separation of configuration and secrets from source code
5.Awareness of common web vulnerabilities (e.g. unauthorized access, weak credentials)

Network & Cloud Security Concepts (Foundational):
1.Client–server architecture
2.Localhost and server-based deployments
3.Understanding of ports, services, and access control
4.Awareness of secure deployment practices in cloud-hosted environments
5.Basic understanding of firewalls, authentication boundaries, and least-privilege access

These concepts guide how projects are structured and how future improvements would be implemented.
