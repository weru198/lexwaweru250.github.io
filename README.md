🔐 Cybersecurity, Network & Cloud Awareness

Security principles applied across projects include:
Secure password storage using hashing
Session-based authentication and access control
Input validation and basic error handling
Separation of configuration and secrets from source code
Awareness of common web vulnerabilities (e.g. unauthorized access, weak credentials)

Network & Cloud Security Concepts (Foundational):
Client–server architecture
Localhost and server-based deployments
Understanding of ports, services, and access control
Awareness of secure deployment practices in cloud-hosted environments
Basic understanding of firewalls, authentication boundaries, and least-privilege access

These concepts guide how projects are structured and how future improvements would be implemented.
